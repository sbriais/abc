                 Mobility Workbench (MWB), an automated tool for
                 manipulating and analyzing mobile concurrent systems
                 (those with evolving connectivity structures) described
                 in the polyadic pi-calculus. The main feature of this
                 version of the MWB is checking open bisimulation
                 equivalences, and doing so with efficiency in mind. The
                 open bisimulation equivalences are described in a
                 polyadic setting, and efficient characterisations of
                 both the strong and the weak equivalences are presented
                 and proven to coincide with their standard
                 formulations. The equivalence checking algorithm, which
                 by necessity generates the state space ``on-the-fly'',
                 is presented in detail and proven correct. Aspects of
                 the implementation of the tool are described in some
                 detail, for example the representation of pi-calculus
                 agents using de Bruijn indices. We illustrate the MWB
                 with an example automated analysis of a handover
                 protocol for a mobile telephone system.",
